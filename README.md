# Calculator App

In this Project I have made a Calculator Project that can do calculations and also record them in the History.
In this Project I have used HTML, CSS to make the basic structure and give styling to the page. I have used JavaScript to add functionality to the calculator app.

# JavaScript Concepts that I have used in this Project:

- Running A For Each Loop On Array.
- eval() function.
- Math.() functions.
- else if statements.
